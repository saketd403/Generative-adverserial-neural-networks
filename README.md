# Generative-adverserial-neural-networks

A simple implementation of Generative Adversarial Neural nets based on the paper "Generative Adversarial Nets" by Ian Goodfellow.(https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf)

There is a single notebook which will demonstrate the implementation as well as the results based on MNIST dataset.
